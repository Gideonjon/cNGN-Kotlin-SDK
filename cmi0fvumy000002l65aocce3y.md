My Journey Building With [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/overview), [OpenAPI Clients](https://swagger.io/specification/) & Real Web3 Mobile Products

For the past few years, I’ve been building mobile applications, mostly fintech, and Android using Kotlin. I’ve built everything from on-chain savings platforms like **Ajo on Umi Network** to cross-chain payment tools like [**Raba**](https://sendraba.xyz/) to microfinance apps, to mobile SDKs and blockchain clients.

2025 opened a new door for me: [**NEAR**](https://pages.near.org/learn/).

It didn’t happen because I was a blockchain expert neither did it happen because I had huge funding.  
It all happened because **NEAR rewards developers who build, contribute and solve real problems.**

This article is a simple and honest guide for Android devs who want to win on NEAR. If you’re striving for :

* Grants
    
* Bounties
    
* Real ecosystem contributions
    
* Mobile SDKs
    
* Open-source tooling
    
* Product-building with NEAR protocol
    

Everything here is practical. It is based on steps I followed and real lessons learned.

# Why Android Developers Are Winning on NEAR

The NEAR Protocol is one of the few ecosystems where **mobile development is not an afterthought**.

<div data-node-type="callout-text">If you are stuck with what NEAR means, check out this <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/what-is-near-protocol-a-guide-to-the-near-ecosystem" style="pointer-events: none">comprehensive explainer</a>.</div>
</div>

Most chains focus heavily on 3 things: smart contracts, backend indexers, and frontend dashboards.  
But NEAR has a growing vision around:

* Mobile onboarding
    
* Wallets
    
* App clients
    
* Cross-chain connectivity
    
* SDKs in all languages
    
* Chain abstraction
    
* Mini-apps and embedded experiences
    
* Developer blogs, tooling, sample apps
    

This makes Android developers extremely important.

Especially Kotlin developers.

> **Mobile is the missing link between Web2 users and Web3 growth.**

NEAR understands this; and that’s why Android devs have a huge advantage with it.

# **How to Start Contributing & Winning on NEAR (Step-by-Step)**

Here’s the exact blueprint I used to go from zero to winning on NEAR.

1. ## **Pick a Problem NEAR Needs Right Now**
    

Don’t start with:

*“I want a grant.”*

Start with:

*“What does NEAR need that I can build?”*

Examples of problems you can solve by building on NEAR includes:

* **Kotlin/Android SDK:**
    

Many devs want native Android access to [NEAR Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction) without needing JavaScript.

* **Wallet SDK for mobile apps:**
    

Native library to integrate NEAR login or transactions into Android apps.

* **Kotlin OpenAPI clients:**
    

Auto-generated clients for interacting with NEAR RPC, account lookup, indexing, or specific contract APIs.

* **Mobile-first dApps**
    

Decentralized mobile apps habving on-chain functionalities.

* **Tools for onboarding:**
    

QR connect, key management UI, signing UI components tools.

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary></summary><div data-type="detailsContent">As a developer enthusiastic about NEAR, you should understand that it rewards <strong>problem solvers</strong>, not <strong>feature wishlists</strong>.</div></details>

2. ## **Start With Small, Public Contributions**
    

The easiest ways to get noticed is to begin with little, **public** contributions

**Build open-source tools like:**

* A Kotlin NEAR RPC wrapper
    
* A sample Kotlin dApp
    
* A wallet connect demo
    
* A NEAR Java/Kotlin library for beginners
    

**Publish tutorials**

* How to use NEAR RPC in an Android app (Kotlin)
    
* “How to build a NEAR wallet on Android”
    
* “Using OpenAPI to generate NEAR clients in Kotlin”
    
* “How to sign transactions on NEAR from Android”
    

**Submit small PRs to NEAR repos**

* Find fixes to make.
    
* Docs to contribute
    
* Examples to make.
    

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary></summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Even <strong>one</strong> helpful PR puts your name on the map.</div></details>

3. ## **Join NEAR’s Working Groups & Developer Programs**
    

NEAR has multiple teams and verticals:

* Developer Governance
    
* Wallets
    
* Tooling & SDKs
    
* Infra Committees
    
* Community Working Groups
    
* Bounties & Hackathons
    
* NEAR Builders Cohort
    

Find these groups and programs on X and Google Search. When you join these circles, something magical happens:

* **People start knowing what you can do.**
    
* **You get tagged for opportunities.**
    
* **You get invited to paid tasks.**
    
* **Your credibility skyrockets.**
    

4. ## **Build Something Real on NEAR (Your Killer Move)**
    

For mobile devs, the most powerful win is:

> **Building a real product using NEAR.**

Not a demo,  
Not a sample repo,  
A real application.

For example, you can build:

* A mobile savings app using NEAR
    
* A creator micro-tipping app
    
* Social tokens with mobile wallets
    
* A NEAR bill-payment gateway
    
* A NEAR-based stablecoin app
    
* Cross-chain swaps with a sleek Android UI
    
* NEAR onboarding inside Android
    

If you’ve used Raba or Ajo before, your experience with them would give you an advantage here as NEAR wants real case studies.

5. ## **Apply for Grants With a Strong Proposal**
    

Your proposal should include:

* The problem you intend solving.
    
* The solution to it.
    
* Why you chose NEAR to solve.
    
* Milestones achieved, even if little.
    
* Project Budget.
    
* Deliverables.
    
* Demo/mockups.
    
* Your portfolio.
    
* A Github with public contributions.
    

6. ## **Stay Consistent & Visible**
    

To win long-term, do these:

* Post progress on X (daily/weekly).
    
* Write blog updates.
    
* Contribute to NEAR Forum discussions.
    
* Help other devs understand NEAR mobile integration.
    
* Publish code samples every week.
    
* Engage with core contributors.
    
* Consistency makes you unstoppable.
